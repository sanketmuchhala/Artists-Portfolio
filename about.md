## Artist Statement

Briannon Sullivan is a San Francisco-based artist working at the intersection of textile art, painting, and mixed media. Her work explores themes of memory, identity, and the materiality of making through layered compositions that combine traditional craft techniques with contemporary art practices.

Drawing on a background in both fine art and textile design, Sullivan's pieces often feature hand-woven elements, found fabrics, and natural fibers integrated with painted surfaces. These materials carry their own histories—personal, cultural, and material—which become part of the work's narrative.

Her recent series investigates the relationship between fragmentation and wholeness, using thread as both a drawing tool and a means of literally binding disparate elements together. The resulting works occupy a space between painting and sculpture, inviting viewers to consider the boundaries between these traditional categories.

## Background

Sullivan received her MFA from California College of the Arts in 2020 and her BFA from Rhode Island School of Design in 2016. She has exhibited throughout the Bay Area and beyond, with recent solo exhibitions at Galerie Moderne (San Francisco) and The Studio Gallery (Brooklyn).

Her work has been featured in *Artforum*, *Art in America*, and *Hyperallergic*, among other publications. She has been awarded residencies at Djerassi Resident Artists Program (2023) and Headlands Center for the Arts (2022).

Sullivan lives and works in San Francisco, California.
